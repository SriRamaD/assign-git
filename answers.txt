¥What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
   
It indicates git not to track certain files and folders. It should contain the files created by the tool namely eclipse or VSCode where we developed the java project.
    
¥What does fast-forward in Git mean?

It is to update the HEAD pointer. It simplifies by moving pointer ahead as there will be no divergent work to merge.

Different branches help in staging changes to main when it is required. This can allow easy access of the project.
